        <h2>Kurt-William</h2>
        <p>I am a 21 year old UWI student studying computer science. I have long had an interest in web design
            and things of that nature. From as early as prep school I coded 3 apps and created my own personal 
            website using wix. Since then I have seen the immense value in having a space on the web that you created. 
            My love for the arts and my scientifc mind finds its comfort in this specific area of Computing.
